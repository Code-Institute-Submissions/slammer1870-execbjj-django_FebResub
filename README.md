## Project Overview
This site is design with a landing page for lead capturing and studio infomration as well as a dashboard for authenticated users. Users can create an account, login, manage their subscriptions, check in for classes, cancel their appointments as well as being able to sign up for newsletter updates and sumbit queries through a contact form. 

## HOW TO USE
To use this website the steps are as follows.

- Step 1: Login users login by navigating to the "/login" route, if user does not have an account they can login by clicking the "Click here to register" link on the login form.\

### Unauthenticated User
Unauthenticated Users can access the landing page, login page and registration page. The site is built with access controls to stop unauthenticated users from accessing the dashboard.

### Standard User
- A standard user can manage their own membership including creating, updating, deleing and check in to classes/cancel their bookings.

### Admin User
- Currently there is no permission restricted only to admin users via the interface of the website. Admin controls are managed through the Django admin dashboard.

## UX
As this is a CRUD based application the key UX features for this site are clear and defined input for accessability. Examples of this can be seen on the chck in and cancel buttons for bookings.\

### Strategy
The strategy behind this website is to use of for a company that I own that is in the process of opening back up after being shut for over a year.

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to deliver a simple, user friendly and intuitive application that allows user to create and manage subscriptions and check into classes

#### User Goals
As a user I want to have a clear and intuitive experience through out the application with consisten visual feedback in the form of flashed messages as I interact with the website.

#### Developer Goals
As a developer I aim to produce an CRUD application with User Authentication as well as a defensive programming design strategy to ensure that user's data is protected.

#### Website Owner Goals
As a product owner I aim to have a piece of software that is built with clean foundational architecture that provides for the ability to add more directly monetisable features like premium membership content and payment integrations into the site.


### User Stories
As a User I want to be able to sign up to a newsletter, submit queries via a contact form, create an account, login, manage my mebership and check into classes.


### Design Choices
The most prominent design choices in this application are to be found in the visual feedback of the alert messages with Green being used for success messages, Yellow for standard operations like post editing and Red for error messages.

As well as this providing users with their own data aggregated into the "My Posts" section is design to that users can access their posts directly from the message board and have the posts that they own filtered in the "My Posts" section.

#### Colors
The colours used in this project are simple Greys and Black for structual elements of the pages, Red and Blue for the edit and delete button and Green, Yellow and Red for visual feedback in the alert messages depening on the nature of the interaction.

#### Typography
The typography used is Montserrat. Montserrat has a clean layout and fits the theme of this site well.

#### Images
The images used are all relating to the activities of the company. They are mostly high quality JPEGs.

#### Design Elements

  window.setTimeout(
    "document.getElementById('alert').style.display='none';",
    5000
  );

# Information Architecture

The functionality of the application is very simple. When a user signs up they are assigned a Stripe customer id via a Django signal.

```
# Receiver to create customer in Stripe and assing their StripeID to the CustomUser object


@receiver(post_save, sender=CustomUser)
def create_stripe_id(sender, instance, **kwargs):

    name = str("{0} {1}").format(instance.first_name, instance.last_name)

    if instance.stripe_customer_id == None:

        stripe_customer = stripe.Customer.create(
            name=name,
            email=instance.email
        )

        instance.stripe_customer_id = stripe_customer["id"]

        post_save.disconnect(create_stripe_id, sender=CustomUser)
        instance.save()
        post_save.connect(create_stripe_id, sender=CustomUser)
```

This Stripe ID is then used for all user interactions with Stripe. A Stripe product ID is assigned to each product that is then used to reference in Stripe.

The business logic for completed payments are handled in the payment success view, this view can handle both individual product purchases as well as subscriptions

```
@login_required
def success_view(request):

    # Gets sessionID from URL parameters
    session_id = request.GET.get("session_id")

    # Gets line item from checkout session
    line_item = stripe.checkout.Session.list_line_items(session_id, limit=1)

    # Retrieves checkout session object
    checkout_session = stripe.checkout.Session.retrieve(session_id)

    if checkout_session['subscription']:
        sub_id = checkout_session['subscription']
    else:
        sub_id = ""

    # Creates new subscription with request user, priceID from line item (only works with one line item), subscriptionID from checkout session and sets status to active
    subscription, created = Subscription.objects.update_or_create(user=request.user, defaults={'membership': Membership.objects.get(
        stripe_price_id=line_item.data[0].price.id), 'stripe_subscription_id': sub_id, 'status': "active"})
    subscription.save()

    messages.success(request, "Thank for you subscribing!")

    return redirect('dashboard_redirect')

```

Updating and deleting subscriptions is handled by a webhook that is sent to the "/webhook" endpoint.

Check ins verify that the user has an active subscription before allowing the function to execute.

## Database Choice

## Testing

### Penetration Testing
Basic penetration testing was done to ensure that unauthenticated users can't access authenticated content and that permissionless users can't edit role based permission functions.

#### Testing Authenticated Routes
    1. Without logging in attempt to access the url "/dashboard"
    2. Using Postman try to send a POST request to the endpoint "/checkin/"
    
#### Result
User is redirected to the login page with the dashboard url set as the value of the "next" paramater in the current url - ***passed*** \
A response telling the user they are unauthenticated is returned - ***passed*** \

### Validation Testing

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Note, because Alpine JS manipulate html element by placing aditional attributes on them such as "x-data" or ":class", there are returned as errors by the validator.
- [PEP8 Validator](https://www.pythonchecker.com/)

### Automated Testing
Due to the fact that there are only two data models and a relatively simple frontend, I did not find situations where automated testing such as integration testing was neccessary as the the app is generally not complex enough to have majorly conflicitng elements or many change breaking features.

### Manual Testing
Much of the app has been tested manually as follows:

#### 1. Newsletter form:
    1. Go to the Index page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    5. Try to sign up as an already subscbribed user.

##### Results
* Index Page loads - ***passed***
* Form return visual feedback for required fields - ***passed***
* Form requests email address with '@' symbol be entered - ***passed***

    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
    4. Try to submit form with mismatched passwords and verify mismatched password message.
    5. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

##### Results
* Registration Page loads - ***passed***
* Form return visual feedback for required fields - ***passed***
* Form requests email address with '@' symbol be entered - ***passed***
